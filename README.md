# Room Condition Monitoring System
Originally developed in 2020 as part of Embedded System Design Course; this repository contains the finalized and cleaned version for public release.
## Overview
This project implements an embedded monitoring system designed to measure room temperature and ambient light intensity, with automatic alarm activation when user-defined thresholds are exceeded. The system enhances environmental awareness and safety by providing real-time feedback and alerts.

**⚙️ Key Features**

- Monitors **temperature** and **light intensity** using onboard sensors.

- **Automatic alarm triggering** upon threshold breaches for quick response.

- Provides **continuous real-time monitoring** with accurate sensor feedback.

**🧠 Design & Implementation**

- Developed and simulated on **Atmel XMEGA A3BU** microcontroller.

- Programmed using **AVR Studio**, ensuring correct sensor interfacing and alert logic.

- Verified **sensor response accuracy** and **reliable alarm activation** through simulation and hardware testing.

**🧰 Tools & Technologies**

- **Microcontroller**: Atmel XMEGA A3BU

- **Software**: AVR Studio

- **Languages**: Embedded C
